# Checkers

Written in Java using the JavaFX GUI library, this project implemenents an interactable game of Checkers with a competitive AI opponent.

The AI uses a Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning to determine the most optimal play for Red player at any given point in the game. By defining the depth of the decision tree, the intelligence of the AI can be changed.

Have fun!
